Ideas for open source sample plugin

### Ideas
 - Use Julia language maybe??? Or Python or LUA.
 - Easy for people to write plugins in several languages
 - Embedded scripting window
 - Could design plugin using Max 8???
 - Can host VCVRack modules
 - Create a bunch of plugins for tape simulation, etc so people can improve their sample libraries
 - Integrate some other UI designer
 - Can load Kontakt libraries
