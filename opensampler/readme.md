### Todo
 - Fill out UI
 - Start on Julia integration
 - Start on Faust integration (example [here](https://youtu.be/INlqClEOhak)). Do Kadenze course. Do official [course](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/faustWorkshops/course2015/).
 - Get CodeEditor JUCE demo integrated
 - Integrate projects from *GuitarML* github user

### Layout
 - Main view is the *instrument view*, which can be flipped to the *modular view*
 - Button on top to open *browser view*
 - Another window for the *utilities view*

---

### Browser View
 - Browse different instruments according to their tags in various folders
 - Can view instrument description with links, preview image, preview audio

### Instrument View
 - Automatically generated from modular view
 - Can select presets from the top here

### Modular View
 - Animate wires to show when signal is passing through
 - Can select presets from the top here

### Utilities View
 - Export current instrument as standalone VST
 - Machine learning sample processing
 - De-noise
 - Isolate vocals, bass, drums, etc
 - Auto sampler for VST
 - Auto sampler for hardware
 - Auto model an amplifier
 - Auto model an effect with deep learning
 - Capture a room impulse response

### Cool Demos
 - Feed EEG from muse into node
 - Feed phone accelerometer into node, dancer puts phone in pocket, live performancee adapts to dancing
 - Search latent space of piano sound or midi GAN
 - Run on eurorack module using Elk audio OS
 - Edit reverb algorithm on the fly

### Promotion
 - Convert every pianobook library to this format
 - Create several awesome libraries to advertise it
 - Fantastic documentation
 - Get a bunch of YouTube composers to make sample libraries for it
 - Get it promoted by Benn and Gear, Venus Theory, etc
 - Email a bunch of eurorack modular people, showing how it can be used in their setups
 - Email a bunch of YouTube composers, showing how it can be used in their setups

### Monitization
 - Jack and I each get paid for the modules/instruments we develop
 - License people to sell sample libraries with it
 - Patreon
   - Advanced usage tutorials
   - Advanced coding tutorials
   - Premium sample libraries
   - Crowdsouce hiring instrumentalists to make professional sample library
   - Premium channels in the Discord
 - Get startup shell funding to host servers, buy things to sample
 - People signed up to Patreon get access to premium samples. People can submit premium samples. 50% of patreon gets distributed to people who make premium samples based on how often the library is used.
 - People can submit their patches to be sold as products for usually $30. They get half. (Don't commercialize too much)
 - iPad app build for 9.99
 - Eurorack module for $599
 - Build sound design course like syntorial for $99
 - Build programming course for $99

### Other
 - Push 2 display integration for sample manipulation. Reference [here](https://github.com/Ableton/push2-display-with-juce)
 - Build it for iPad/iPhone also. Priced at 9.99.
