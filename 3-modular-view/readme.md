# Modular View

### General
 - When signal goes through wire, animate wire in a subtle way with recoloring or something
 - Make buttons/faders/etc nodes with location settings, graphic settings, etc inside. Don't do "promote to main view" checkboxes.

### Module Ideas
 - Modules from every Faust built in effect
 - Amp simulators
 - Phone accelerometer
 - Muse connector
 - Basic oscillator
 - Wavetable oscillator (with promotable custom UI element for main view)
 - Mixer
 - Various physical modeling synths
