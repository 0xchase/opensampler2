# opensampler
Ideas for open source sample plugin. Maybe augment decent sampler instead.

 - Fill out UI
 - Start on Julia integration
 - Start on Faust integration (example [here](https://youtu.be/INlqClEOhak)). Do Kadenze course. Do official [course](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/faustWorkshops/course2015/).
 - Get CodeEditor JUCE demo integrated
 - Integrate projects from *GuitarML* github user
